# DaGzang
 A Synthetic Data Generator for Cross-domain Recommendation Services

 This study aims to propose a platform, called DaGzang, to generate synthetic datasets provide for cross-domain recommendation systems. DaGzang platform working according to the complete loop and it has three major roles as follows (i) detect the overlap association (data distribution pattern) between the real-world datasets, (ii) generate synthetic datasets based on these real-world datasets, and (iii) evaluate the quality of the generated synthetic datasets. Additionally, DaGzang is deployed into DakGalBi, our cross-domain recommender system, in order to validate the usefulness of the synthetic datasets generated.
